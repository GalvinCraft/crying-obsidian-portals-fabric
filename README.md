Crying (Obsidian) Portals is a mod that allows you to create nether portals using crying obsidian.

![Demonstration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GalvinCraft/crying-obsidian-portals-fabric/main/.github/assets/javaw_JheUovCevb.png)

# Usage
Use the `/findplayer` command and enter the player's name. There is also a dropdown of players, so you don't have to type it in full and can use autocomplete!

# Compatible Versions
| Mod Version | Game Version(s) | Mod Version Title |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1.0.0       | 1.21 - 1.21.1   | 1.0.0+1.21        |

# Important Note
This mod is a **server-side** and **client-side** mod!

Also, it is not possible to combine Obsidian and Crying Obsidian in the same portal due to the mechanics of the portals API I'm using.
